# üì± Android WebView App - Simple Template

**Turn your website into an Android app in 5 minutes!** No Java knowledge needed. No powerful PC required - use GitHub Actions to build your app in the cloud! üöÄ

## üéØ What is This?

This template lets you wrap your website into a native Android app. Perfect for:

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Get the Project

**Option A: Fork on GitHub** (Recommended for GitHub Actions)
1. Click the **Fork** button at the top of this page
2. Now you have your own copy!

**Option B: Download ZIP**
1. Click **Code ‚Üí Download ZIP**
2. Extract the folder

### Step 2: Open in Android Studio (Optional - Skip if using GitHub Actions)

If you have a good PC and want to build locally:
1. Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Open the project folder
3. Wait for Gradle sync to finish (this takes a few minutes the first time)

**Don't have a good PC?** No problem! Skip this and use GitHub Actions instead (see section above).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customize Your App

You need to change a few things to make this app yours. Use the search feature in your code editor to find these special tags:

### üîç How to Search

**In Android Studio:** Press `Ctrl+Shift+F` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+F` (Mac)

**In VS Code or any editor:** Use the search function to find the tags

---

### üè∑Ô∏è 1. Change Your App Name

Search for: **`<APPNAME>`**

**File:** `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`

```xml
<string name="app_name">WebView App</string>
<!-- <APPNAME> - Change "WebView App" to your app's name -->
```

**What to do:** Replace `"WebView App"` with your app name

**Example:**
```xml
<string name="app_name">My Awesome App</string>
```

This is the name that appears under your app icon on the phone.

---

### üì¶ 2. Change Package Name (IMPORTANT!)

Search for: **`<PACKAGE_NAME>`**

The package name is like your app's unique ID. It must be unique across all Android apps. **You need to change it in 3 files:**

#### File 1: `app/build.gradle`

```groovy
applicationId "com.example.app" // <PACKAGE_NAME> - Change this to your unique package name
```

**What to do:** Change `"com.example.app"` to something unique

**Example:**
```groovy
applicationId "com.john.myawesomeapp"
```

**Package name rules:**
- Use lowercase letters only
- Format: `com.yourname.appname`
- No spaces or special characters
- Must be unique (check if it exists on Play Store)

#### File 2: `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml
<!-- <PACKAGE_NAME> - Must match the package name in build.gradle -->
<manifest
    package="com.example.app"
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">
```

and also this line inside the same file:

```xml
android:name="com.example.app.MainActivity"
<!-- <PACKAGE_NAME> - Must match the package name in build.gradle -->
```

**What to do:** Change both `com.example.app` to match what you put in build.gradle

#### File 3: `app/src/main/java/com/example/app/MainActivity.java`

```java
package com.example.app; // <PACKAGE_NAME> - Must match the package name in build.gradle and AndroidManifest.xml
```

**What to do:** Change `com.example.app` to match your package name

---

### üóÇÔ∏è Important: Rename Your Folder Structure

After changing the package name in all 3 files, you need to **rename the actual folders** too!

**In Android Studio (Easiest Way):**

1. In the left sidebar, find the `java` folder
2. You'll see folders like `com ‚Üí example ‚Üí app`
3. **Right-click** on the package name (the part that shows like `com.example.app`)
4. Select **Refactor ‚Üí Rename**
5. Type your new package name (e.g., `com.john.myawesomeapp`)
6. Click **Refactor**
7. Android Studio will automatically rename all folders and update all references!

**Why do this?** The folder structure must match your package name. If your package is `com.john.myapp`, the folders should be `com/john/myapp/`. Android Studio's refactor tool does this automatically!

**Without Android Studio?** You'll need to:
1. Manually rename the folders from `com/example/app` to `com/yourname/yourapp`
2. Make sure all 3 files have the matching package name

---

### üî¢ 3. Set Your App Version

Search for: **`<VERSION_CODE>`** and **`<VERSION_NAME>`**

**File:** `app/build.gradle`

```groovy
versionCode 1 // <VERSION_CODE> - Increment this: 1, 2, 3, 4...
versionName "1.0" // <VERSION_NAME> - Your version: "1.0", "2.0", "2.5"...
```

**What to do:**
- **versionCode**: A number. Start with 1, then 2, 3, 4... Each time you update your app, increase this by 1.
- **versionName**: A string. This is what users see. Like "1.0", "2.0", "2.5.1", etc.

**When to change:** Every time you release a new version of your app.

---

### üñºÔ∏è 4. Change Your App Icon

Search for: **`<ICON>`**

Your app icon appears on the phone's home screen. You need **different sizes** of your icon for different devices.

**Where to replace:**
- `app/src/main/res/mipmap-mdpi/ic_launcher.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png` (72x72 pixels)
- `app/src/main/res/mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png` (96x96 pixels)
- `app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxhdpi/ic_launcher.png` (144x144 pixels)
- `app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher.png` (192x192 pixels)

Also replace the round versions:
- `ic_launcher_round.png` in all the same folders

---

---

### üåê 5. Set Your Website URL

Search for: **`<WEBSITE_URL>`**

This is the website that will load in your app.

#### File 1: `app/src/main/java/com/example/app/MainActivity.java`

```java
// REMOTE RESOURCE
mWebView.loadUrl("https://kigemmanuel.github.io"); // <WEBSITE_URL> - Change this to your website URL
```

**What to do:** Replace `"https://kigemmanuel.github.io"` with your full website URL

**Example:**
```java
mWebView.loadUrl("https://www.mywebsite.com");
```

#### File 2: `app/src/main/java/com/example/app/MyWebViewClient.java`

```java
String hostname = "kigemmanuel.github.io"; // <WEBSITE_URL> - Change to your domain (no https://)
```

**What to do:** Replace with just your domain name (without `https://` or `www.`)

**Examples:**
- If your site is `https://www.mywebsite.com` ‚Üí use `"mywebsite.com"`
- If your site is `https://myblog.github.io` ‚Üí use `"myblog.github.io"`

**Why two files?** The first file loads your website. The second file keeps links inside your app and opens external links in the browser.

---

### üì± 6. Using Local HTML Files (Optional)

Want to bundle HTML files **inside** your app instead of loading from the internet?

Search for: **`<LOCAL_HTML>`**

1. **Put your files** in the `app/src/main/assets/` folder
   - Your main file should be named `index.html`
   - Include all CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.

2. **In MainActivity.java**, change these lines:

```java
// Comment out the remote URL:
// mWebView.loadUrl("https://kigemmanuel.github.io"); // <WEBSITE_URL>

// Uncomment the local file line:
mWebView.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/index.html"); // <LOCAL_HTML>
```

Now your app will load the local HTML instead of a website!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### "Package name already exists"
**Problem:** Your package name isn't unique
**Solution:** Choose a different package name. Check Google Play Store to see if it's taken.

### "Build failed" in GitHub Actions
**Problem:** Syntax error or wrong file format
**Solution:** Check your changes. Make sure you didn't accidentally delete important code.

### "App won't install on phone"
**Problem:** Package name conflicts with existing app
**Solution:** Uninstall the old app first, or use a different package name.

### "White screen when opening app"
**Problem:** Wrong URL or no internet connection
**Solution:** Check your URL is correct. Make sure your phone has internet. Check AndroidManifest.xml has `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />`.

### "Icon not changing"
**Problem:** Old icons still cached
**Solution:** In Android Studio: **Build ‚Üí Clean Project**, then **Build ‚Üí Rebuild Project**

### "External links open in the app"
**Problem:** Wrong hostname in MyWebViewClient.java
**Solution:** Make sure the hostname matches your website's domain exactly.
